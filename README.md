Welcome to Ground-Up Machine Learning (GML) - a personal project that sprang from my desire to demystify the world of machine learning (ML) for friends and colleagues who expressed a keen interest but found themselves overwhelmed by the existing resources. This course is my attempt to break down ML into digestible, engaging, and accessible segments, ensuring that anyone, regardless of their background, can grasp the fundamentals of machine learning and see its beauty and utility in the modern world.

## Introduction & Overview

### The Genesis of GML

The inception of GML was not a planned endeavor but a response to the genuine curiosity and, at times, frustration voiced by those around me. They sought a pathway into ML that didn't start with daunting mathematics or require sifting through countless hours of content to find practical, engaging learning experiences. As someone deeply passionate about making education accessible and enjoyable, I saw an opportunity to create something uniqueâ€”a course that would serve as an introductory handshake to ML, offering a friendly welcome to beginners and a clear, concise overview for busy learners. Thus, GML was born, crafted from the ground up to introduce you to the marvels of machines that learn.

### What We Hope to Achieve

GML is designed to light a spark of interest in machine learning, providing you with:
- A foundational understanding of ML concepts applied in real-world scenarios.
- The ability to distinguish between different types of ML: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning.
- Practical skills through hands-on experience with essential ML tools and libraries, applying your knowledge to real datasets.

### Target Audience

This course is ideally suited for:
- Absolute beginners curious about machine learning.
- Busy individuals seeking a streamlined yet meaningful overview of ML.
- Educators looking for a structured guide to introduce ML concepts to students.

### Prerequisites

A foundational knowledge of Python is expected, as the course will briefly touch upon Python basics but primarily focus on applying it within ML contexts. Additionally, while not math-heavy, a basic understanding of calculus and linear algebra can enrich your learning experience. Nonetheless, these are not dealbreakers; with a willingness to learn and explore these topics on your own, you'll find this course both manageable and rewarding.

### Tools and Libraries

We'll be leveraging several key Python tools and libraries throughout GML:
- **Python:** The primary language of instruction.
- **NumPy and Pandas:** For numerical computing and data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For visualizing data.
- **Scikit-learn:** For easy-to-use ML models.

### Course Structure

GML unfolds over four weeks, each dedicated to a different facet of machine learning:
1. **Introduction to ML & Supervised Learning - Regression**
2. **Supervised Learning - Classification**
3. **Unsupervised Learning & Clustering**
4. **Introduction to Reinforcement Learning**

Each week includes a lecture guide and lab materials designed not as exhaustive resources but as interactive guides akin to slides that a teacher can use to lead discussions, demonstrations, and hands-on projects. The course is crafted with the classroom in mind, requiring an instructor to breathe life into the content. As such, it's perfect for educators or study groups seeking a structured path to explore ML together.

### Expected Effort

To fully benefit from what GML offers, participants are expected to commit to approximately 2-3 hours of lecture time and 6-7 hours of self-study each week. This self-study time includes going through lab materials, completing assignments, and additional reading or practice as needed. The weekly structure is flexible and can be adjusted based on individual or group needs, making the course adaptable to different learning environments.

### Ideal Way to Follow the Curriculum

GML is structured to maximize learning through interaction, hands-on practice, and experimentation. To get the most out of this course, we recommend the following approach:

1. **Engage with the Lecture Content:** Whether you're learning solo with an online community, in a classroom, or part of a study group, start by digesting the lecture content together. This collaborative approach allows for discussion, clarification of concepts, and sharing of insights, making the learning experience richer and more comprehensive.

2. **Hands-on Practice with Lab Material:** After the lecture, dive into the lab material. This is where you'll get practical experience with the topics and methods introduced during the lecture. The labs are designed to be interactive, allowing you to apply what you've learned in a guided environment. Ideally, this should be done with the support of a teacher or within your study group, providing a collaborative space to explore and learn from each other.

3. **Weekly Assignments:** Each week, you'll be tasked with an assignment that encourages you to implement and experiment with the week's topics. These assignments are crucial for deepening your understanding, as they require you to build concepts from scratch. Writing and debugging your code, and reflecting on your approach, will ensure you have a solid grasp of the material. These assignments are not only about reinforcing what you've learned but also about fostering creativity and problem-solving skills in real-world scenarios.

#### Why This Approach?

Learning machine learning, or any complex subject, is best achieved through a blend of theoretical understanding and practical application. By following this structured approach, you're not just passively absorbing information; you're actively engaging with the material, applying it in practical contexts, and solidifying your understanding through creation and collaboration. This methodology is designed to cater to diverse learning styles and to accommodate varying schedules, making ML accessible to everyone interested in embarking on this journey.

### Join the Journey

GML is more than just a course; it's an invitation to explore the world of machine learning in a way that's engaging, accessible, and, most importantly, grounded in real-world application. Whether you're teaching a class, learning with peers, or guiding yourself through the fundamentals of ML, GML offers the tools, insights, and inspiration to embark on this exciting journey.

Welcome to Ground-Up Machine Learning. Let's discover the power of machines that learn, together.

## Week 1: Introduction to ML & Supervised Learning - Regression

In this week, we will start with the basics of Machine Learning, and then move on to the fundamentals of Supervised Learning, focusing on Regression. We will also introduce the tools we will be using throughout the course, and discuss the importance of understanding data in Machine Learning.

I found that the best way to learn is by doing, so I am emphasizing that when teaching/studying this course we need to ask bunch of questions and do a lot of discussions. Also in the notebooks I tried to add bunch of interactive examples to make the learning process more fun and engaging.
